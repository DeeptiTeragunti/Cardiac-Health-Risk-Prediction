# Cardiac-Health-Risk-Prediction


# Objective
This code focuses on applying unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, to assess cardiac health. By exploring and preprocessing a dataset, applying clustering algorithms, and evaluating the results, and aims to develop insights into the usefulness and interpretability of clustering in real-world healthcare applications, particularly in risk assessment.

# Dataset: Cardiac Health Records
The dataset, Modified_Heart_failure_data.csv, includes 11 features related to cardiac health. Key features such as Anaemia, Platelet Count, Creatinine Phosphokinase, Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure contribute to assessing heart disease risk factors.

# Potential Applications of the Data:
Risk Stratification: Identify high-risk individuals for personalized treatment plans.
Healthcare Resource Allocation: Support efficient distribution of healthcare resources.
Public Health Insights: Provide data-driven insights for preventive health strategies.
The clustering analysis will uncover patient patterns, facilitating better decision-making and improved healthcare outcomes.
